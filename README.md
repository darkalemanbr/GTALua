# GTALua-Online
This version of GTALua if forked from Freeeaky's project, but has many changes to its code, mainly some code cleanup and option to allow its use online. This is the copy that I was using online back in the days.
It is updated to the latest game version, but it can't be used to go online anymore. Online modding is not operational in the main game.
This could be used though, in theory, to go "online" on mods like FiveReborn and MultiFive.

# GTALua
GTALua is a powerful and flexible scripting engine for GTA V. You can easily create new scripts and even reload them without restarting the game. Writing own plugins has never been as easy.
